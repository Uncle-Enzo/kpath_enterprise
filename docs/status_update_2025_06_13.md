   - Role-based access control (admin, editor, viewer)
   - API Key generation and management

2. **Semantic Search Engine**
   - FAISS-based vector search operational
   - Automatic index building on startup
   - Natural language query understanding
   - Sample services loaded for testing
   - Sub-100ms search latency

3. **Full Admin Interface**
   - Dashboard with system metrics
   - Service management (CRUD operations)
   - User management (admin only)
   - API key generation interface
   - Search testing interface
   - Responsive design

4. **Backend API**
   - RESTful API fully documented
   - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - JWT and API key authentication
   - Rate limiting on API keys
   - Health check endpoints

### Issues Fixed Today

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Fixed restart.sh to use correct pyenv (torch-env)
   - Added PYTHONPATH for module imports
   - Fixed search service initialization

2. **Authentication/Authorization**
   - Fixed JWT token decoding (string/int conversion)
   - Added missing is_active field to User model
   - Fixed API key endpoint routing
   - Resolved 401/403 redirect issues

3. **Search Functionality**
   - Fixed search endpoint path (/api/v1/search/search)
   - Added automatic FAISS index initialization
   - Created sample services for testing
   - Fixed embedding service initialization

### Quick Start Guide
