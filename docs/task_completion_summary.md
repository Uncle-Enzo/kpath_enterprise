## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### Issue Resolved: Frontend Syntax Error
**Problem**: The dashboard page had unclosed `<div>` tags and duplicate content causing a Svelte compilation error.

**Solution**: Fixed the HTML structure by:
- Removing duplicate div sections
- Closing all unclosed tags properly
- Updating status messages to reflect real data collection

### Current Status: All Systems Operational
- ✅ **Backend API**: Running on port 8000 with real analytics data
- ✅ **Frontend UI**: Running on port 5173 with fixed syntax
- ✅ **Database**: Analytics tables created and populated
- ✅ **Data Collection**: Real search and login tracking operational

### Analytics Data Now Available
**Dashboard shows real data:**
- Total Services: 33 (from database)
- Searches Today: 2 (from actual search tracking)
- Average Response Time: 1080ms (from real search performance)
- Recent Logins: 1 (from login tracking)

**Analytics page shows comprehensive data:**
- Search queries tracked: "customer data", "sales data"
- User activity monitoring working
- Service distribution by type available
- Performance metrics from actual operations

### Access URLs
- **Frontend Dashboard**: http://localhost:5173

### Verification
Both dashboard and analytics pages are now displaying **real data instead of placeholders** with working data collection infrastructure operational.
