# KPATH Enterprise - Feature Implementation Summary

## Date: June 12, 2025

### Features Implemented

## 1. Domain & Capability Filtering (Feature A)

### Implementation Details:
- Modified `FAISSSearchService.semantic_search()` to support filtering
- Filters are applied post-search to maintain semantic relevance scores
- Increased initial search results (3x limit) to account for filtering

### Filtering Logic:
- **Domain Filtering**: Case-insensitive exact match on service domains
- **Capability Filtering**: Case-insensitive substring match on capability descriptions
- Both filters can be used together (AND operation)

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Filter by domain only
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "service", "domains": ["Finance"]}'

# Filter by capability only
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "service", "capabilities": ["invoice"]}'

# Combined filtering
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "communication", "domains": ["Communication"], "capabilities": ["email"]}'
```

### Test Results:
- ✅ Domain filtering: Successfully filtered InvoiceAPI by "Finance" domain
- ✅ Capability filtering: Successfully filtered by "invoice" capability
- ✅ Combined filtering: Successfully filtered EmailService with both criteria

## 2. Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation (Feature C)

### Implementation Details:
- Enhanced FastAPI app configuration with comprehensive description
- Added OpenAPI tags for endpoint grouping
- Added detailed endpoint documentation with examples
- Improved authentication documentation

### Documentation Features:
1. **Main API Documentation** (`/docs`):
   - Interactive Swagger UI
   - Try-out functionality for all endpoints
   - Authentication flow documentation
   - Example requests and responses

2. **ReDoc Documentation** (`/redoc`):
   - Alternative documentation interface
   - Better for reading/printing
   - Same content as Swagger

3. **Endpoint Tags**:
   - `auth`: Authentication operations
   - `search`: Semantic search operations
   - `services`: Service registry management
   - `users`: User management
   - `health`: Health and status checks

### Key Documentation Improvements:
- Added comprehensive API overview in main description
- Documented authentication requirements
- Added search examples with filtering
- Included test credentials in login documentation
- Enhanced search endpoint with detailed feature descriptions

### Access Documentation:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
- OpenAPI JSON: http://localhost:8000/openapi.json

## Summary

Both requested features have been successfully implemented:

1. **Search Filtering**: Fully functional domain and capability filtering that works seamlessly with the semantic search
2. **API Documentation**: Comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with examples and detailed descriptions

The KPATH Enterprise API now provides:
- Powerful semantic search with AI understanding
- Flexible filtering options for precise service discovery
- Self-documenting API with interactive exploration
- Clear examples and usage patterns

The system is ready for integration with external orchestration systems that can leverage these search and filtering capabilities.
