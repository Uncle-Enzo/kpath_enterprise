ðŸ“Š Shoe-Focused Token Testing
================================

## Updated Focus (June 19, 2025)
All test scenarios updated to focus on shoe-related queries since ShoesAgent is the only operational agent.

2. **Shoe Shopping - Running**: "find running shoes under $150"  
3. **Shoe Shopping - Work Boots**: "I need steel toe work boots"
4. **Shoe Shopping - Dress**: "formal dress shoes for wedding"
5. **Shoe Shopping - Size Check**: "check if Nike Air Max size 10 is available"
6. **Shoe Store Locator**: "find shoe stores near me"
7. **Shoe Buying Advice**: "what shoes are best for flat feet"
8. **Shoe Delivery Tracking**: "track my shoe order delivery"
