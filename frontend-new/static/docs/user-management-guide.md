- Passwords are securely hashed and stored
- Never share passwords or store them in plain text

### Account Security

3. **Contact Information**: Use work email addresses when possible
4. **Documentation**: Keep records of why accounts were created

#### Role Assignment
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give users only the access they need
2. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review user roles and adjust as needed
3. **Role Changes**: Update roles when users change responsibilities
4. **Temporary Access**: Use time-limited accounts for temporary users

#### Account Maintenance
1. **Regular Audits**: Review user accounts quarterly
2. **Cleanup Inactive**: Deactivate or delete unused accounts
3. **Update Information**: Keep user contact information current
4. **Monitor Activity**: Watch for unusual user behavior

### Organizational Guidelines
